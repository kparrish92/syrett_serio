### The results of the model

Model structure: `brm(Selection ~ CategoryType + (CategoryType | Participant)` 

`Selection` had four levels: "Elaine right","Akira right", "Both", and "Neither". The model predicted the log-odds of each choice as a function of `CategoryType`.

`CategoryType` had three levels: "Natural", "Abstract" (Value) and "Artifact".

`Participant`: There were X participants, each with X data points total (6 per `CategoryType`). the model included a random slope of category type per participant. This both takes into account the nested structure of the data and allows for the estimation of individual probabilities per `CategoryType`. 

This is another simple model that will serve as the model we use for the sensitivity analysis - we should dicuss priors. We can use the data from experiment 2, potentially. 

I also want to discuss this experiment to make sure I am understanding it, since we have mostly discussed the first two experiments. I have some data from last year that shows two data files, which I tidied. 

```{r}
describe_posterior(four_choice_mod) %>% 
  as_tibble() %>% 
  select(-c("CI", "ROPE_CI", "ROPE_low", "ROPE_high")) %>% 
  mutate(ESS = round(ESS)) %>% 
  knitr::kable(format = "pandoc", digits = 2)

```


## The conditional effects based on the model 

This plot and table were generated from the model using the `conditional_effects` function in R. The function just does the addition needed and conversion to probability as a convenience. 

```{r}
conditional_effects(four_choice_mod, categorical = TRUE)
```

```{r}
conditional_effects(four_choice_mod, categorical = TRUE)[["CategoryType:cats__"]] %>% 
  select(effect1__, effect2__, estimate__, lower__, upper__) %>% 
  mutate(estimate__ = round(estimate__, digits = 2)) %>% 
  mutate(lower__ = round(lower__, digits = 2)) %>% 
  mutate(upper__ = round(upper__, digits = 2)) %>% 
  mutate(model_effect = paste0(estimate__, " [", lower__, " - ", upper__, "]")) %>% 
  rename("CategoryType" = "effect1__") %>% 
  select(CategoryType, effect2__, model_effect) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = effect2__, values_from = model_effect) %>% 
  knitr::kable(format = "pandoc", digits = 2)
```
